# Introduction
Java’s standard java.net.URL class and standard handlers for various URL prefixes unfortunately are not quite adequate enough for all access to low-level resources. For example, there is no standardized URL implementation that may be used to access a resource that needs to be obtained from the classpath, or relative to a ServletContext. While it is possible to register new handlers for specialized URL prefixes (similar to existing handlers for prefixes such as http:), this is generally quite complicated, and the URL interface still lacks some desirable functionality, such as a method to check for the existence of the resource being pointed to.

不幸的是，Java的标准java.net.URL类和各种URL前缀的标准处理程序不足以满足所有对低级资源的访问。 例如，没有标准化的URL实现可用于访问需要从类路径或与ServletContext相关的资源。 尽管可以为专门的URL前缀注册新的处理程序（类似于诸如http:之类的前缀的现有处理程序），但这通常相当复杂，并且URL接口仍然缺少某些期望的功能，例如检查被指向资源是否存在的方法。
